First get the random path based on metapath of the network.
Run rand_walk.py.
Confirm the network is formed by networkx.


Second vectorize the network using metapath2vec++. 
Here is the main part code of it. 
If you want to use it to vectorize network,  use the metapath2vec++.cpp which is written by c++.


Last is the result compare.
Simply run the Sort.py.
